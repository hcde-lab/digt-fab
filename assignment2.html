                    Design prompt criteria: <br>
               <li> Criteria #1: Make a CAD model of (an updated version of) your construction kit, such that the thickness of the material is a variable input.</li>
                <li> Criteria #2: Include other new design features to your kit, e.g. patterns or images.</li> 
                <li> Criteria #3: Cut a minimum of 6 new shapes (can be identical or different) out of 2 different thickness of material. </li>
                <li> Criteria #4: When press-fit, your models should not come apart with a light shaking!</li>


                <h2> Ideation / Develop </h2>
                <p> 
                    The first thing I did was dimension the old puzzle pieces so I could fix minor issues and define variables to create a clearer understanding of the dimensioned relationships between pieces. 
                    Ideally the changes would have created a more flush and compact piece earlier on in the developement.  <br> 
                    This created mental clarity for me around making adjustments to the sketch's variables such that they keep the Press Fit intact.

                <h2> Test / Implementation / Deliver </h2>
                <p> 
                    Upon Jumping over to draw the model in Rhino and Grasshopper, I realized that the dimensioned drawings was tangental to the process required for Grasshopper. <br>
                    As such, I went back to the drawing board to create a process for Grasshopper that would additionally simplify the model. <br>
                    The variable "T" stands for the the cardboard thickness, as seen in the second photo.

                    <h3> Problem: </h3>
                    Among smaller issues like accidentally starting a fire, I know that knowing a more efficient manner to solve the problem i encountered in Solidworks impacted and drained my patience while learning.
                    <br>
                    Using Solidworks daily for a niche specialization in modeling aerospace tools into orthographic drawings created an internal bias while learning Visual Scripting.
                     <br>
                     To overcome this I had to realize that I experienced "Law of the Instrument" or "Confirmation bias". <br>
                     <li> Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses. </li>
                    <li> The concept known as the law of the instrument is a cognitive bias that involves an over-reliance on a familiar tool.</li> <br>
                    
                    <br>

                    <h3> Solution: </h3>                 
                    
                    My solution to this issue was to mentally let go of my Mechanical Engineering & Solidworks training so that I could focus on learning how to correctly create a CAD Visual Diagram.
                    <br>                   
                    For example, when I look at a 2D image to consider it's 3 dimensions, I slice it in half and consider how I would get this outcome if I was subtracting the material. <br>
                    With Visual Diagrams in Grasshopper, one has to break down the model into small dimensions which make up the components from the ground up.

                <h2>Reflection</h2>

                <p> 
                In hindsight, i should have paused the developement of pieces until I was more familiar with the software. 
                <br> Instead I should include pausing during the researching the process to design the pieces with the new software in mind before heavily developing a product.
                <br>
