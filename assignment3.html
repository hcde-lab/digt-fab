                <h2> Synthesis / Define </h2>
                       
                    Design prompt criteria: <br>
               <li> Criteria #1: Make a lamp using both laser cut and 3D printed parts. </li>
                <li> Criteria #2: Imagine your lamp being in a domestic setting---perhaps it will not be wildly shaken, but it should not fall apart with normal use. </li> 
                <li> Criteria #3: Consider Form and Function </li>



                <h2> Ideation / Develop </h2>
                <p> 
                    The first thing i did was seek out inspiration online and brainstormed ideas. <br>
                    <a href="https://www.gail-prevezer.com/laser-cut-light-box"></a> <img src="Images/Inspiration.jpg"  width=400> </a> 

                    <br> In the sketch below,  I explored how University of Washington's Logo could be integrated into a lamp. <br>
                    <img src="Images/UW.jpg" width=400>
                    <br> 
                    After considering the time it would take to manufacture the prototype, I pivoted away from this design in addition to thinking about the value proposition created by the end user and the function of the lamp.
                </p>
                    <br>                
                    <img src="Images/Sketch v1.jpg" width=400>
                    <br>

                    In the model below, I created a smart speaker holder inside of the lamp. <br> 
                    Due to printing constraints, I was unable to print off a model w/ smart speaker feature. <br>

                <br>          
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>

                    <p>
                      
                    </p>
                
               
                <h2> Test / Implementation / Deliver </h2>
                <p> 
                    I utilized Solidworks and Illustrator to prioritize Rapid prototyping in a timely manner rather than diving deeper into learning the Rhino software <br>
                    <br>
                    This enabled me to better I utilize my time more efficiently than the last few projects. <br>
                    The laser cut pieces were measured for the most part correctly, requiring only a handful tweaks to create a press fit. <br>
                    The 3D model was setup correctly, but struggled from hardware limitations. <br>
                    In the end, this benefited my workflow since as soon as i could cut/print I did, which allowed me to identify errors earlier on. <br>
                    <br>

                    <h3> Problem: </h3>
                    The largest issue with this project was getting a 3D printer to work correctly.  <br>
                    I used two different printers before finally finding a third working printer that would lay down fillament correctly.

                    <h3> Solution: </h3>                 
                    
                    My solution to this issue was to troubleshoot the issue with about every solution in the book.
                    <br> From changing printers to tweaking the model, to buying new filament. 
                    <br> In the end, sometimes it is as simple as a hardware failure.  <br>
                    Overall, I did a good job not getting bogged down on these details and continued to itterate through my prototype in a timely manner without emotional distress. 
                    <br>                   
                        
                        <br>  
                </p>
                </p>
                
                <br>
                       
                <br>
                       
                <br>
                       
                <p> 
                       <img src="Images/Light 8.jpg" width=400>  <br> 
                       In the end, the lamp changes colors according to music/noise. 
                       <br> Additionally, the user can adjust the function (lighting/shadows) of the lamp by removing puzzle pieces from the fractal portion of the lamp.

                <h2>Reflection</h2>

                <p> 
                In hindsight, I should have split the 3D printed model in half to reduce time to print. <br>
                That way I could have started printing two 6 hour prints instead of one 12 hour print.   
                <br> 
                <br>
