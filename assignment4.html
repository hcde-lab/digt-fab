                    Design prompt criteria: <br>
               <li> Criteria #1: Model an assembly with more than one part, with at least one moving part, in Onshape.  </li>
                <li> Criteria #2: Fabricate your assembly by laser cutting or 3D printing or a combination of both. </li> 
                <li> Criteria #3: The motion should be intentional, smooth, and robust. </li>



                <h2> Ideation / Develop </h2>
                <p> 
                    Originally I wanted to create a threaded screw with a simple threaded nut. <br>
                    <br>
                    The goal was to keep it simple, so I found thread dimensions in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machinery%27s_Handbook"> "Machinery's Handbook".  </a>
                    <br>
                    After exploring Onshape, I discovered the "Shell" tool which allowed me to create a Compartment inside of the screw.
                    <br> This adjustment influenced the top down design approach to modeling the screw and Cap. 
                    <br>

                       As per usual with Digital Fabrication, tweaking the models and the print outs is a necessrey portion of the process.
                       <br>
                       In the end, this print required multiple printers to successfully produce models.
                       In total about three Dremel printers "brokedown" while personally in-use and I was able to observe one being taken apart to be repaired.

                    <h3> Problem: </h3>
                    
                    <br>
                    <p> After creating the screw with 10 threads per inch in the original sketch, I realized early on that I would encounter an error in the manufacturing process.  
                            <br> During the early stages of development I created the threads such that they created multiple disconnected threads; rather than one cohesive thread.
                        <br> 
                        When a screw is manufactured, it is going through the subtractive process, thus the threads are cut out of the metal. 
                        <br> With this in mind, I reframed my approach to modeling the CAD model to consider the additive manufacturing process. 
                        <br>

                <p> 
                   
                   <p> 
                    <h3> Solution: </h3>                 
                    
                    
                    <br> 
                    I redesigned the sketch threads such that the thread cut out followed along a helix path of the male part piece. 
                    <br> In the end, I used the male threads sketch to reverse engineer and draw the cap piece into a new a part. <br> 
                    This required me to learn about the "Pierce" constraint which allowed me to constrain a sketch with another feature.
                    <br>
                    The final threads parts move exceptionally well with a ~.05" clearance between threads.                   <br>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>

                <p> 
                        In hindsight, I should have considered the thread path of the female holder before printing the first batch. 
                        Overall, I am satisfied with this print model. 
                        <br>
                        It feels like the first time the entire creative process of modeling process and printing has been a personal achievement. 
                        <br> Specifically, when the final print rotate freely along the thread path it's a very satisfying feeling.
